# Disney-Characters
  Disney Character is an app that feches data from [DisneyCharacters API](https://api.disneyapi.dev/).The App is meant to help in learning and improving my skills in building android app using [Clean architecture](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/what-is-clean-architecture-in-android/).
  
Min Api Level : 21

## Setup Requirements

- Android device or emulator
- Android Studio

## Getting Started

In order to get the app running yourself, you need to:

1.  Clone this project
2.  Import the project into Android Studio
3.  Connect the android device with USB or just use your emulator
4.  In Android Studio, click on the "Run" button.

## Libraries

Libraries used in the whole application are:

- [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin) - Kotlin is a programming language that can run on JVM. Google has announced Kotlin as one of its officially supported programming languages in Android Studio; and the Android community is migrating at a pace from Java to Kotlin
- [Android KTX](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/ktx)-Android KTX is a set of Kotlin extensions that are included with Android Jetpack and other Android libraries. KTX extensions provide concise, idiomatic Kotlin to Jetpack, Android platform, and other APIs.
- [LifeCycle](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/lifecycle)-Lifecycle-aware components perform actions in response to a change in the lifecycle status of another component, such as activities and fragments. These components help you produce better-organized, and often lighter-weight code, that is easier to maintain.
- [Shimmer](https://facebook.github.io/shimmer-android/)-Shimmer is an Android library that provides an easy way to add a shimmer effect to any view in your Android app. It is useful as an unobtrusive loading indicator that was originally developed for Facebook Home.
- [MVVM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mvvm-model-view-viewmodel-architecture-pattern-in-android/) - MVVM stands for Model, View, ViewModel. Model: This holds the data of the application. It cannot directly talk to the View. Generally, it's recommended to expose the data to the ViewModel through Observables.
- [Glide](https://guides.codepath.com/android/Displaying-Images-with-the-Glide-Library) - Glide is an Image Loader Library for Android developed by bumptech and is a library that is recommended by Google. It has been used in many Google open source projects including Google I/O 2014 official application. It provides animated GIF support and handles image loading/caching. 
- [Paging3](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/v3-overview)-The Paging library helps you load and display pages of data from a larger dataset from local storage or over network. This approach allows your app to use both network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently.
- [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) - Coroutines are computer program components that generalize subroutines for non-preemptive multitasking, by allowing execution to be suspended and resumed. Coroutines are well-suited for implementing familiar program components such as cooperative tasks, exceptions, event loops, iterators, infinite lists and pipes.
- [Kotlin Flows](https://developer.android.com/kotlin/flow) - In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.

- [Retrofit](https://abhiandroid.com/programming/retrofit) - In Android, Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android by Square inc under Apache 2.0 license. Its a simple network library that used for network transactions. By using this library we can seamlessly capture JSON response from web service/web API.
- [Dagger Hilt](https://developer.android.com/training/dependency-injection/hilt-android) -Koin is a pragmatic and lightweight dependency injection framework for Kotlin developers.
